Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Its the systematical application of designing, developing and maintaining software.
It plays a crucial role in designing softwares which are easy and simple to use in everyday life from communications, commerce and healthcare.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Establishment of software engineering- It brought about software engineering discipline which developed adequate and efficient programming methods such as proper designing and documentation.
Development of programming languages- It allowed programmers to write understandable codes enabling developers to communicate instructions to computers in a structered way.
Advent of structered programming- It emphasized clear, hierarchical program structure and control flow which laied the foundation of mordern programming practices.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement- Its the gathering and documenting of user needs and system requirements
Design- Its the creating and detailing of the software and user interface
Implementation-Its the writing and building of the software according to the design.
Testing- Its conducting of various test to ensure quality, effectiveness and functionability of the software
Deployment- Releasing the software to the client or user
Maintenance- Providing support, update and enhancement of the software after deployment.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall has a sequential approach with distinct phase where it has to be completed before moving to the next while Agile methodologies has an  Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and change adaptability.
Waterfall will be appropriately used in construction projects, manufacturing, long-time projects and reguratory projects while Agile methodologies will be appropriately used in Software start-ups, marketing campaigns, app or web development and research and development projects
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Writes codes and implements software solutions
Quality Assuarance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager- Oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are used for Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code example is Visual Studio
Version Control System Is a software tool used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among teammates example Git
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements- Requirements may change during development cycle which causes project delay
Tight Deadlines- Pressure to deliver software will impend the quality caused by rush to meet deadline
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit-Testing individual components or modules of the software
Integration- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System- Testing the entire system as a whole
Acceptance- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Its the crafting of questions or statements to get the best response from AI models
Prompt Engineering helps get clear and accurate response.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt "Tell me about Language", an improved prompt is "Tell me about the history of language"
The prompt is effective since its clear, specific and concise.
